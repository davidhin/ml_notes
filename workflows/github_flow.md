# Basic GitHub Guideline

#### Project Board Setup

1. Create a new project board (in a GitHub repository, go to the "Projects" tab)
2. The project board name can be anything (e.g. main, the name of the tool, etc)
3. Under Project template, choose "*Automated kanban*"
4. The project board displays issues in a three-column layout (to do, in progress, done). GitHub gives you additional info on how to use it. 

#### Main Workflow

> Note: This is just a guideline on GitHub flow, but it can be modified as necessary (see notes). 

1. Create a new issue + description. Usually, it's good to follow a consistent issue description template (see an example below). Assign all new issues to the project board you created earlier - they will automatically be added to the "To do" column, and moved to "Done" when the issue is closed. 
2. Create a branch called JOB-# where # is the issue number (this can be done locally or through GitHub) For example, if Issue #1 is "APIs for getting attack patterns for a given consequence", then the code relating to this issue should be submitted to a branch named JOB-1.
3. Once you're happy with your code, push the JOB-1 branch to GitHub. Create a pull request from JOB-1 to Master. If there's nothing to say in the PR description, just link it to the issue (e.g. closes #1). Request a code reviewer (if doing code review).
4. (If doing code review): If the reviewer has comments/changes to make, commit your changes to the branch with the name: "QA-# blah blah blah", where # is the Pull Request Number and blah blah blah is a short description of what you fixed. 
5. (If doing code review): Once the reviewer accepts the pull request, it can be merged into the Master branch. The JOB-1 branch can now be deleted and Issue #1 can be closed. 

#### Example Issue Description Template

Below is an example of an issue following a defined structure. Note that it is more oriented towards agile software development (user stories, acceptance criteria), so it may not apply to all projects. The issue is written in markdown, so checkboxes are written as "- [ ]"

> **User Story** 
> 
> As a user, I want to be able to see if my requests are loading so that I know to wait to not resend requests that are being processed.
>
> **Acceptance Criteria** 
>
> - [x] Add loading page after uploading files. 
> - [x] Add loading page after file explorer page. 
> - [ ] Add loading page after checking files on project page.

#### Additional Notes:

- Do not commit directly to master
- Branch names should follow the JOB-# naming scheme (all caps, dash, number).
- Try to keep issues and the code in their corresponding PR self-contained, coherent, and not too large. 
- You should use an automatic formatter, linter, etc for your code  to keep things consistent. 
- Issue/PR tags are optional (e.g. if you want to add priority tags in Step 1, you can, otherwise you don't have to)
- This workflow omits a "dev" branch, as it is not entirely necessary for small projects. However, use of a dev branch would mean that during Step 5, the PR is merged into a permanent "dev" branch instead of master. During set milestone periods (e.g. 2 weeks), the dev branch can be merged into master, providing all tests pass.
